# Automatic-Ball-calculator-
The Automatic Ball Calculator helps reduce the amount of bad pool table players in the world. This is accomplished by displaying the predicted path of the ball upon entering the hitting position. This is done with tracking the angle of the cue to the cue ball and displaying the predicted path. The tracking will operate using a computer vision library on Python called OpenCV and a webcam is holstered directly above a pool table to give live feed to the program.
